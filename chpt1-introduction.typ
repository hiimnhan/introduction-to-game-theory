== What is game theory?
Game Theory aims to help us understand situations in which decision-makers interact. It can be firms competing for business, bidders competing in an auction, couple decide which concerts to attend,... It is everywhere

== Theory of rational choice
The theory is based on a model with two components: a set $A$ consisting of all the actions that, under some circumstances, are available to the decision-maker, and a specification of the decision-maker's preferences.
=== Actions
The decision-maker knows about this subset of available choices, and takes it as given; in particular, the subset is not influenced by decision-maker's preferences. The set $A$ could, for example, be the set of bundles of goods that the decision-maker can possibly consume.
=== Preferences and payoff function
Preferences in game theory describe what a player likes or wants more compared to other options. They show how a player ranks different outcomes from most to least desirable.
We can "represent" preferences by _payoff function_, which associates a number to each action in a sense that actions with high numbered are preferred. More precisely, the payoff function $u$ represents a decision-maker's preferences if, for any action $a$ in $A$ and $b$ in $A$,
$
u(a) > u(b) "if and only if the decision-maker prefers" a "to" b "."
$<payoff_func>

A better name than payoff function might be "preference indicator function" or "utility function".
=== The theory of rational choice
The theory of rational choice is that in any given situation the decision-maker chooses the member of the available subset of A that is best according to her preferences. Allowing for the possibility that there are several equally attractive best actions, *the theory of rational choice* is:

#align(center)[
  #set par(justify: false)
  the action chosen by a decision-maker is at least as good, according to her preferences, as every other available action.
